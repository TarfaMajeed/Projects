Week 1: ANN and Data Mining
- ANN Project: [Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Keras library with NumPy and TensorFlow backend to predict specific outcome.]
- Data Mining Project 1: [ Conducted a data mining project using a diabetes dataset to predict specific outcome. Applied data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling. ]
- Data Mining Project 2: [Conducted a data mining project using weather-related data to discover hidden patterns and relationships. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, applied the Apriori algorithm to generate association rules. Identified strong associations between specific  variables and gained insights into weather patterns.]

Week 2: NLP and Decision tree
- NLP Project 1: [Conducted an NLP project analyzing past speeches to extract insights and patterns. Utilized analytical libraries to identify and extract linguistic features such as:
    - Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: verbs, prepositions, nouns, etc.
    - Syntax and semantics analysis
    - Other relevant features (e.g., sentiment, tone)]
- NLP Project 2
- decision tree : [Utilized scikit-learn (SKL) library to generate models of varying complexity and evaluate their performance. Implemented logistic regression to assess accuracy and other relevant metrics.]
- lemmanization : [ Utilized NLTK library to analyze sentences and extract linguistic features. Imported corpus and used tokenizer to:
    - Identify synonyms and antonyms of words in sentences
    - Determine part-of-speech (POS) tags for words in sentences]
