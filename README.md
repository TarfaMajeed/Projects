Week 1: ANN and Data Mining
- ANN Project: [Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Keras library with NumPy and TensorFlow backend to predict specific outcome.]
- Data Mining Project 1: [ Conducted a data mining project using a diabetes dataset to predict specific outcome. Applied data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling. ]
- Data Mining Project 2: [Conducted a data mining project using weather-related data to discover hidden patterns and relationships. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, applied the Apriori algorithm to generate association rules. Identified strong associations between specific  variables and gained insights into weather patterns.]

Week 2: NLP and Decision tree
- NLP Project 1: [Conducted an NLP project analyzing past speeches to extract insights and patterns. Utilized analytical libraries to identify and extract linguistic features such as:
    - Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: verbs, prepositions, nouns, etc.
    - Syntax and semantics analysis
    - Other relevant features (e.g., sentiment, tone)]
- NLP Project 2
- decision tree : [Utilized scikit-learn (SKL) library to generate models of varying complexity and evaluate their performance. Implemented logistic regression to assess accuracy and other relevant metrics.]
- lemmanization : [ Utilized NLTK library to analyze sentences and extract linguistic features. Imported corpus and used tokenizer to:
    - Identify synonyms and antonyms of words in sentences
    - Determine part-of-speech (POS) tags for words in sentences]

Week 3: Data Mining
- Search Engine Project: [Developed a search engine for skincare products using a dictionary-based approach. Created a dictionary with product names and details, then converted it into a pandas DataFrame. Applied NLP techniques to enhance search functionality, including:
    - Tokenization: breaking down product names and descriptions into individual words
    - Stemming: reducing words to their base form
    - Lemmatization: normalizing words to their dictionary form
    - Implemented a search function allowing users to find product details by entering a product name]
- Sementics Similarity Project: [ Utilized NLTK library to determine the similarity between two words. Specifically, explored synonyms and antonyms of the word to understand its semantic relationships.]
- Spacey Project: [Used spacy for named entity recognization]

Week 4: NLP and Clustering
- Clustering Project: [Briefly describe the project and its objectives]
- Steaming Spam Cleaning Project: [Briefly describe the project and its objectives]
- Task 2 Project: [Briefly describe the project and its objectives]
- Task 2 Fourth Project: [Briefly describe the project and its objectives]
