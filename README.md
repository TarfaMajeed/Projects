Week 1: ANN and Data Mining
- ANN Project: [Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Keras library with NumPy and TensorFlow backend to predict specific outcome.]
- Data Mining Project 1: [ Conducted a data mining project using a diabetes dataset to predict specific outcome. Applied data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling. ]
- Data Mining Project 2: [Conducted a data mining project using weather-related data to discover hidden patterns and relationships. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, applied the Apriori algorithm to generate association rules. Identified strong associations between specific  variables and gained insights into weather patterns.]

Week 2: NLP and Decision tree
- NLP Project 1: [Conducted an NLP project analyzing past speeches to extract insights and patterns. Utilized analytical libraries to identify and extract linguistic features such as:
    - Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: verbs, prepositions, nouns, etc.
    - Syntax and semantics analysis
    - Other relevant features (e.g., sentiment, tone)]
- NLP Project 2
- decision tree : [Utilized scikit-learn (SKL) library to generate models of varying complexity and evaluate their performance. Implemented logistic regression to assess accuracy and other relevant metrics.]
- lemmanization : [ Utilized NLTK library to analyze sentences and extract linguistic features. Imported corpus and used tokenizer to:
    - Identify synonyms and antonyms of words in sentences
    - Determine part-of-speech (POS) tags for words in sentences]

Week 3: Data Mining
- Search Engine Project: [Developed a search engine for skincare products using a dictionary-based approach. Created a dictionary with product names and details, then converted it into a pandas DataFrame. Applied NLP techniques to enhance search functionality, including:
    - Tokenization: breaking down product names and descriptions into individual words
    - Stemming: reducing words to their base form
    - Lemmatization: normalizing words to their dictionary form
    - Implemented a search function allowing users to find product details by entering a product name]
- Sementics Similarity Project: [ Utilized NLTK library to determine the similarity between two words. Specifically, explored synonyms and antonyms of the word to understand its semantic relationships.]
- Spacey Project: [Used spacy for named entity recognization]

Week 4: NLP and Clustering
- Clustering Project: [Conducted a clustering project using various algorithms to group similar data points into clusters. Utilized libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn (SKL) to:
    - Apply K-Means clustering algorithm to identify clusters in the dataset
    - Plot the clusters to visualize the results
    - Calculate the silhouette score to evaluate the quality of the clusters
    - Implement DBSCAN clustering algorithm to identify clusters with varying densities
    - Plot the DBSCAN clusters to visualize the results
    - Apply K-Prototypes clustering algorithm to handle mixed data types
    - Calculate the silhouette score for K-Prototypes clusters]
- Steaming Spam Cleaning Project: [Utilized Porter Stemmer algorithm to reduce words to their base form, ensuring that words with the same root are treated as the same word. Applied stemming to normalize text data and reduce dimensionality.]
- Spam Project: [This project is a spam detection system using NLP techniques. It preprocesses text data by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, tokenizing, and removing stopwords. The goal is to train a model to classify text messages as spam or ham. The project utilizes libraries like NLTK, Pandas, and NumPy.]
