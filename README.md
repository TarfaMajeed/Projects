Week 1: ANN and Data Mining
- ANN Project: [Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Keras library with NumPy and TensorFlow backend to predict specific outcome.]
- Data Mining Project 1: [ Conducted a data mining project using a diabetes dataset to predict specific outcome. Applied data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling. ]
- Data Mining Project 2: [Conducted a data mining project using weather-related data to discover hidden patterns and relationships. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, applied the Apriori algorithm to generate association rules. Identified strong associations between specific  variables and gained insights into weather patterns.]

Week 2: NLP
